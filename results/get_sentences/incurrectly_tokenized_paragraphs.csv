are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus. the fund's sai may be obtained, free of charge, in the same manner as the prospectus. investment objective the fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. fees and expenses these tables are intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses you will pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. shareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment) maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) none maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of offering price) none

fees, interest, taxes, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses are excluded from the cap. after this time, the cap may be increased or the commitment to maintain the cap may be terminated only with the approval of the board of trustees. example of expenses the example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. the example assumes a $10,000 initial investment, 5% annual total return, and that operating expenses remain the same as in the tables above. the example also assumes that the total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver shown above will only be in place for the length of the current waiver commitment. although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: after: 1 year $84 3 years $262 5 years $455 10 years $1,014 portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions,when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 87% of the average value of its portfolio. principal investment strategies under normal circumstances, we invest: at least 80% of the fund's net assets in equity securities of medium-capitalization

frequently. we look for undervalued companies that we believe have the potential for above average capital appreciation with below average risk. rigorous fundamental research drives our search for companies with favorable reward-to-risk ratios and that possess, a long-term competitive advantage provided by a durable asset base, strong balance sheets, and sustainable and superior cash flows. typical investments include stocks of companies that are generally out of favor in the marketplace, or are undergoing reorganization or other corporate action that may create above-average price appreciation. we regularly review the investments of the portfolio and may sell a portfolio holding when a stock nears its price target, downside risks increase considerably, the company's fundamentals have deteriorated, or we identify a more attractive investment opportunity. principal investment risks an investment in the fund may lose money, is not a deposit of wells fargo bank, n.a.

are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus. the fund's sai may be obtained, free of charge, in the same manner as the prospectus. investment objective the fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. fees and expenses these tables are intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses you will pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. shareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment) maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) none maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of offering price) none annual fund operating expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) management fees 0.70% distribution (12b-1) fees 0.00% other expenses 0.11% acquired fund fees and expenses 0.01% total annual fund operating expenses 0.82% fee waivers 0.00% total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver 1 0.82% 1. the adviser has committed through january 31, 2015, to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to cap the fund's total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver at 0.82% for class r6. brokerage commissions, stamp duty fees, interest, taxes, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses are excluded from the cap. after this time, the cap may be increased or the commitment to maintain the cap may be terminated only with the approval of the board of trustees. example of expenses the example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. the example assumes a $10,000 initial investment, 5% annual total return, and that operating expenses remain the same as in the tables above. the example also assumes that the total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver shown above will only be in place for the length of the current waiver commitment. although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: after: 1 year $84 3 years $262 5 years $455 10 years $1,014 portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions,when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 87% of the average value of its portfolio. principal investment strategies under normal circumstances, we invest: at least 80% of the fund's net assets in equity securities of medium-capitalization companies. we invest principally in equity securities of medium-capitalization companies, which we define as securities of companies with market capitalizations within the range of the russell midcap® index at the time of purchase. the market capitalization range of the russell midcap® index was approximately $737.7 million to $32.0 billion as of december 31, 2013, and is expected to change frequently. we look for undervalued companies that we believe have the potential for above average capital appreciation with below average risk. rigorous fundamental research drives our search for companies with favorable reward-to-risk ratios and that possess, a long-term competitive advantage provided by a durable asset base, strong balance sheets, and sustainable and superior cash flows. typical investments include stocks of companies that are generally out of favor in the marketplace, or are undergoing reorganization or other corporate action that may create above-average price appreciation. we regularly review the investments of the portfolio and may sell a portfolio holding when a stock nears its price target, downside risks increase considerably, the company's fundamentals have deteriorated, or we identify a more attractive investment opportunity. principal investment risks an investment in the fund may lose money, is not a deposit of wells fargo bank, n.a. or its affiliates, is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency, and is primarily subject to the risks briefly summarized below. issuer

are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus. the fund's sai may be obtained, free of charge, in the same manner as the prospectus. investment objective the fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. fees and expenses these tables are intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses you will pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. shareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment) maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) none maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of offering price) none annual fund operating expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) management fees 0.70% distribution (12b-1) fees 0.00% other expenses 0.11% acquired fund fees and expenses 0.01% total annual fund operating expenses 0.82% fee waivers 0.00% total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver 1 0.82% 1. the adviser has committed through january 31, 2015, to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to cap the fund's total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver at 0.82% for class r6. brokerage commissions, stamp duty fees, interest, taxes, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses are excluded from the cap. after this time, the cap may be increased or the commitment to maintain the cap may be terminated only with the approval of the board of trustees. example of expenses the example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. the example assumes a $10,000 initial investment, 5% annual total return, and that operating expenses remain the same as in the tables above. the example also assumes that the total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver shown above will only be in place for the length of the current waiver commitment. although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: after: 1 year $84 3 years $262 5 years $455 10 years $1,014 portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions,when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 87% of the average value of its portfolio. principal investment strategies under normal circumstances, we invest: at least 80% of the fund's net assets in equity securities of medium-capitalization companies. we invest principally in equity securities of medium-capitalization companies, which we define as securities of companies with market capitalizations within the range of the russell midcap® index at the time of purchase. the market capitalization range of the russell midcap® index was approximately $737.7 million to $32.0 billion as of december 31, 2013, and is expected to change frequently. we look for undervalued companies that we believe have the potential for above average capital appreciation with below average risk. rigorous fundamental research drives our search for companies with favorable reward-to-risk ratios and that possess, a long-term competitive advantage provided by a durable asset base, strong balance sheets, and sustainable and superior cash flows. typical investments include stocks of companies that are generally out of favor in the marketplace, or are undergoing reorganization or other corporate action that may create above-average price appreciation. we regularly review the investments of the portfolio and may sell a portfolio holding when a stock nears its price target, downside risks increase considerably, the company's fundamentals have deteriorated, or we identify a more attractive investment opportunity. principal investment risks an investment in the fund may lose money, is not a deposit of wells fargo bank, n.a. or its affiliates, is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency, and is primarily subject to the risks briefly summarized below. issuer risk. the value of a security may decline because of adverse events or circumstances that directly relate to conditions at the issuer or any entity providing it credit or liquidity support. liquidity

markets generally or particular industries. regulatory risk. changes in government regulations may adversely affect the value of a security. an insufficiently regulated industry or market might also

liquid than larger company stocks. value style investment risk. value stocks may lose value and may be subject to prolonged depressed valuations. performance the following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the fund by showing changes in the fund's performance from year to year. the fund's average annual total returns are compared to the performance of one or more

appreciation. fees and expenses these tables are intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses you will pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. shareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment) maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) none maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of offering price) none

fees, interest, taxes, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses are excluded from the cap. after this time, the cap may be increased or the commitment to maintain the cap may be terminated only with the approval of the board of trustees. example of expenses the example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. the example assumes a $10,000 initial investment, 5% annual total return, and that operating expenses remain the same as in the tables above. the example also assumes that the total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver shown above will only be in place for the length of the current waiver commitment. although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: after: 1 year $84 3 years $262 5 years $455 10 years $1,014 portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions,when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 87% of the average value of its portfolio. principal investment strategies under normal circumstances, we invest: at least 80% of the fund's net assets in equity securities of medium-capitalization companies. we invest principally in equity securities of medium-capitalization companies, which we define as securities of companies with market capitalizations within the range of the russell midcap® index at the time of purchase. the market capitalization range of the russell midcap® index was approximately $737.7 million to $32.0 billion as of december 31, 2013, and is expected to change frequently. we look for undervalued companies that we believe have the potential for above average capital appreciation with below average risk. rigorous fundamental research drives our search for companies with favorable reward-to-risk ratios and that possess, a long-term competitive advantage provided by a durable asset base, strong balance sheets, and sustainable and superior cash flows. typical investments include stocks of companies that are generally out of favor in the marketplace, or are undergoing reorganization or other corporate action that may create above-average price appreciation. we regularly review the investments of the portfolio and may sell a portfolio holding when a stock nears its price target, downside risks increase considerably, the company's fundamentals have deteriorated, or we identify a more attractive investment opportunity. principal investment risks an investment in the fund may lose money, is not a deposit of wells fargo bank, n.a. or its affiliates, is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency, and is primarily subject to the risks briefly summarized below. issuer

intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses you will pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. shareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment) maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) none maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of offering price) none annual fund operating expenses (expenses that you pay

expenses 1.36% fee waivers 0.04% total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver 1 1.32% 1. the adviser has committed through january 31, 2015, to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to cap the fund's total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver at 1.31% for investor class. brokerage commissions, stamp duty fees, interest, taxes, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses are excluded from the cap. after this time, the cap may be increased or the commitment to maintain the cap may be terminated only with the approval of the board of trustees. example of expenses the example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. the example assumes a $10,000 initial investment, 5% annual total return, and that operating expenses remain the same as in the tables above. the example also assumes that the total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver shown above will only be in place for the length of the current waiver commitment. although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: after: 1 year $134 3 years $427 5 years $741 10 years $1,632 portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions,when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 87% of the average value of its portfolio. principal

however, mere asset allocation and volatility are not the sole determination of risk. your manager will tactically allocate away from the target allocation as market conditions and the perceived risks warrant. the fund bears the risk that the manager’s tactical allocation will not be successful. the risks of the fund are the same risks applicable to the underlying usaa funds in which the fund invests. the risks will apply proportionally according to the allocation to each applicable underlying usaa fund. by investing in the underlying usaa funds, the fund has exposure to the risk of many different areas of the market. the degree to which the risks described below apply to the fund varies according to the fund’s asset allocation. for instance, the more the fund is allocated to stock funds, the greater the expected risk associated with equity securities. the fund also is subject to asset allocation risk ( i.e. , the risk that target allocations will not produce intended results) and to management risk ( i.e. , the risk that the selection of underlying usaa funds will not produce intended results) as well as tactical allocation risk. in managing a fund that invests in underlying usaa funds, the adviser may be subject to potential conflicts of interest in allocating the fund’s assets among the various underlying usaa funds because the fees payable to it by some of the underlying usaa funds are higher than the fees payable by other underlying usaa funds and because the adviser also is responsible for managing and administering the underlying usaa funds. the fund may invest in underlying usaa funds that invest in equity securities, which are subject to stock market risk. a company’s stock prices in general may decline over short or even extended periods, regardless of the success or failure of a company’s operations. equity securities tend to be more volatile than bonds. in addition, to the degree the fund invests in foreign securities, there is a risk that the value of those investments will decrease because of unique risks, such as currency exchange rate fluctuations; foreign market illiquidity; emerging market risk; increased price volatility; uncertain political conditions; exchange control regulations; foreign ownership limits; different accounting, reporting, and disclosure requirements; difficulties in obtaining legal judgments; and foreign withholding taxes. the fund may invest in underlying usaa funds that invest in bonds. there is the risk that the market value of those bonds will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, changes in supply and demand for fixed-income securities, or other market factors. bond prices are linked to the prevailing market interest rates. in general, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall and when interest rates fall, bond prices rise. the price volatility of a bond also depends on its maturity. generally, the longer the maturity of a bond, the greater is its sensitivity to interest rates. to compensate investors for this higher interest rate risk, bonds with longer maturities generally offer higher yields than bonds with shorter maturities. the fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates due to the current period of historically low rates. the fixed-income securities in the fund’s portfolio are subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that an issuer of a fixed-income security cannot make timely interest and principal payments on its securities or that negative market perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline. the fund accepts some credit risk as a recognized means to enhance an investor’s return. all fixed-income securities varying from the highest quality to the very speculative have some degree of credit risk. fixed-income securities rated below investment-grade, also known as junk or high-yield bonds, generally entail greater economic, credit, and liquidity risk than investment-grade securities. their prices may be more volatile, especially during economic downturns and financial setbacks or liquidity events. the fund may change the allocation of its portfolio holdings on a frequent basis, which may result in a high portfolio turnover. in purchasing and selling securities in order to reallocate the portfolio, the fund will pay more in brokerage commissions than it would without a reallocation policy. the fund may have a higher proportion of capital gains and a lower return than a fund that does not have a reallocation policy. an investment in the fund is not a deposit in usaa federal savings bank, or any other bank, and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency.",the fund also is subject to asset allocation risk ( i.e.,i.e.

8,56084,56084,0001104659-16-116355,2016,vp conservative strategy fund,"the success of the fund's investment strategy depends on simc's allocation of assets among the underlying sei funds and its selection of other investment companies, etps and derivative instruments in which to invest that portion of the fund's assets not allocated to the underlying sei funds. in managing the fund, simc may be incorrect in assessing market trends or the value or growth capability of particular asset classes or other investments. in addition, the methodology by which simc allocates the fund's assets among the underlying sei funds and other investments may not achieve desired results and may cause the fund to lose money or underperform other comparable mutual funds. the underlying sei funds and other investment companies and etps in which the fund invests may apply any of a variety of investment strategies and may invest in a broad range of asset classes, securities and other investments to attempt to achieve their designated investment goals. the principal risks of the fund as a result of its investments in the underlying sei funds and other investment companies, etps or other investments are set forth below. asset allocation risk — the risk that simc's decisions regarding asset classes and underlying sei funds will not anticipate market trends successfully. below investment grade securities (junk bonds) risk — fixed income securities rated below investment grade (junk bonds) involve greater risk of default or downgrade and are generally more volatile than investment grade securities because the prospect for repayment of principal and interest of many of these securities is speculative. because these securities typically offer a higher rate of return to compensate for these risks, they are sometimes referred to as ""high yield bonds,"" but there is no guarantee that an investment in these securities will result in a high rate of return. commodity investments risk — certain underlying sei funds may invest a portion of their assets in a wholly owned subsidiary that is not registered under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (1940 act), and invests directly in commodities and commodity-related instruments. other underlying sei funds may have indirect exposure to commodities by investing in commodity-related instruments. commodity investments and derivatives may be more volatile and less liquid than direct investments in the underlying commodities themselves. commodity-related equity returns can also be affected by the issuer's financial structure or the performance of unrelated businesses. the value of a commodity investment or a derivative investment in commodities is typically based upon the price movements of a physical commodity, a commodity futures contract or commodity index or some other readily measurable economic variable that is dependent upon changes in the value of commodities or the commodities markets. the value of these securities will rise or fall in response to changes in the underlying commodity or related benchmark or investment, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as natural disasters, weather and u.s. and international economic, political and regulatory developments. currency risk — as a result of the fund's and certain underlying sei funds' investments in securities or other investments denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies, the fund will be subject to currency risk. currency risk is the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the u.s. dollar or, in the case of hedging positions, that the u.s. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency hedged. in either event, the dollar value of an investment in the fund or an underlying sei fund would be adversely affected. currency exchange rates may fluctuate in response to, among other things, changes in interest rates, intervention (or failure to intervene) by u.s. or foreign governments, central banks or supranational entities, or by the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the united states or abroad. derivatives risk — the use of futures contracts, forward contracts, options and swaps is subject to market risk, leverage risk, correlation risk and liquidity risk. many over-the-counter (otc) derivative instruments will not have liquidity beyond the counterpart to the instrument. market risk is the risk that the market value of an investment may move up and down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. leverage risk is the risk that a small percentage of assets invested in a derivative can have a disproportionately larger impact on the fund or an underlying sei fund. correlation risk is the risk that changes in the value of a derivative instrument may not correlate perfectly with changes in the value of the derivative instrument's underlying asset, rate or index. liquidity risk is the risk that the derivative may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time and the price that the fund or an underlying sei fund would like, which may cause the fund or the underlying sei fund to have to lower 3 sei / summary prospectus the selling price, sell other securities instead or forego an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on the fund's or the underlying sei fund's management or performance. the use of swaps and over-the-counter forward contracts and options is also subject to credit risk and valuation risk. credit risk is the risk that the issuer of a security or counterparty to a derivatives contract will default or otherwise become unable to honor its financial obligation to the fund or the underlying sei fund under the contract. valuation risk is the risk that the derivative may be difficult to value. each of the above risks could cause the fund or an underlying sei fund to lose more than the principal amount invested in a derivative instrument. some derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the fund's or an underlying sei fund's initial investment. the other parties to certain derivative contracts present the same types of credit risk as issuers of fixed income securities. the fund's or an underlying sei fund's use of derivatives may also increase the amount of taxes payable by shareholders. recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. the extent and impact of the regulation are not yet fully known and may not be for some time. new regulation of derivatives may make them more costly, may limit their availability or may otherwise adversely affect their value or performance. equity market risk — the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time. exchange-traded products risk — the risks of owning interests of an etp, such as an etf, etn or exchange-traded commodity pool, generally reflect the same risks as owning the underlying securities or other instruments that the etp is designed to track. the shares of certain etps may trade at a premium or discount to their intrinsic value ( i.e. , the market value may differ from the net asset value (nav) of an etp's shares). for example, supply and demand for shares of an etf or market disruptions may cause the market price of the etf to deviate from the value of the etf's investments, which may be emphasized in less liquid markets. the value of an etn may also differ from the valuation of its reference market or instrument due to changes in the issuer's credit rating. by investing in an etp, the fund or an underlying sei fund indirectly bears the proportionate share of any fees and expenses of the etp in addition to the fees and expenses that the fund and its shareholders directly bear in connection with the fund's operations. because certain etps may have a significant portion of their assets exposed directly or indirectly to commodities or commodity-linked securities, developments affecting commodities may have a disproportionate impact on such etps and may subject the etps to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. fixed income market risk — the prices of fixed income securities respond to economic developments, particularly interest rate changes, as well as to perceptions about the creditworthiness of individual issuers, including governments and their agencies. generally, the fund's fixed income securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and vice versa. in a low interest rate environment, risks associated with rising rates are heightened. declines in dealer market-making capacity as a result of structural or regulatory changes could decrease liquidity and/or increase volatility in the fixed income markets. in the case of foreign securities, price fluctuations will reflect international economic and political events, as well as changes in currency valuations relative to the u.s. dollar. in response to these events, the fund's value may fluctuate and/or the fund may experience increased redemptions from shareholders, which may impact the fund's liquidity or force the fund to sell securities into a declining or illiquid market. foreign investment/emerging markets risk — the risk that non-u.s. securities may be subject to additional risks due to, among other things, political, social and economic developments abroad, currency movements, and different legal, regulatory and tax environments. these additional risks may be heightened with respect to emerging market countries because political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions are more likely to occur in these countries. investment company risk — when the fund or an underlying sei fund invests in an investment company, in addition to directly bearing the expenses associated with its own operations, it will bear a pro rata portion of the investment company's expenses. in addition, while the risks of owning shares of an investment company generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying investments of the investment company, the fund may be subject to additional or different risks than if the fund or an underlying sei fund had invested directly in the underlying investments. real estate industry risk — securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate industry may be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate. risks commonly associated with the direct ownership of real estate include fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. short sales risk — a short sale involves the sale of a security that a fund does not own in the expectation of purchasing the same security (or a security exchangeable therefore) at a later date at a lower price. short sales entered into by an underlying sei fund expose the fund to the risk that the underlying sei fund will be required to buy a security sold short (also known as ""covering"" the short position) at a time when the security has appreciated in value, thus resulting in a loss to the underlying sei fund and, therefore, the fund, that is potentially unlimited. reinvesting proceeds received from short 4 sei / summary prospectus selling may create leverage, which can amplify the effects of market volatility on the share price of an underlying sei fund and, therefore, the fund. investment in short sales may also cause an underlying sei fund to incur expenses related to borrowing securities. in addition, shorting a future contract may require posting only a margin that may amount to less than the notional exposure of the contract. such a practice may exacerbate the loss in a case of adverse price action. small and medium capitalization risk — small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. in particular, small and medium capitalization companies may have limited product lines, markets and financial resources and may depend upon a relatively small management group. therefore, small and medium capitalization stocks may be more volatile than those of larger companies. small and medium capitalization stocks may be traded over-the-counter or listed on an exchange. u.s. government securities risk — although u.s. government securities are considered to be among the safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to changing interest rates. obligations issued by some u.s. government agencies are backed by the u.s. treasury, while others are backed solely by the ability of the agency to borrow from the u.s. treasury or by the agency's own resources. investing in the fund involves risk, and there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its investment goal. you could lose money on your investment in the fund, just as you could with other investments.",the shares of certain etps may trade at a premium or discount to their intrinsic value ( i.e.,i.e.
9,69167,69167,0001193125-18-143878,2018,state street hedged international developed equity index fund,"you could lose money by investing in the fund. an investment in the fund is subject to investment risks, including possible loss of principal, is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency. the fund may not achieve its investment objective. general risks associated with the fund's investment policies and investment strategies are discussed below. because the fund expects to achieve investment exposure through the portfolio, it is subject to substantially all of the risks associated with the portfolio. the fund is not intended to be a complete investment program, but rather is intended for investment as part of a diversified investment portfolio. investors should consult their own advisers as to the role of the fund in their overall investment programs. 3 in addition, the fund is subject to the following risks: counterparty risk: the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties with which the fund enters into derivatives contracts, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and other transactions. if a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, the fund may be unable to terminate or realize any gain on the investment or transaction, or to recover collateral posted to the counterparty, resulting in a loss to the fund. if the fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it may be delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the counterparty. currency hedging risk: when a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the fund holds, any gain generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by losses on the hedged investment, and vice versa. while hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between a derivative and its reference asset. for example, because the fund's currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis, based on the size of the fund's exposure to a currency at a certain point in time, the size of each currency hedge could be greater or less than the fund's total exposure in that currency intra-month and currency risk may develop or increase between resets. furthermore, while the fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. as a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect fund returns even when the hedge works as intended. the effectiveness of the fund's currency hedging strategy will also generally be affected by both the volatility of the securities included in the index, and the volatility of the u.s. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged. increased volatility may reduce the effectiveness of the fund's currency hedging strategy and may impact the costs associated with hedging transactions. the effectiveness of the fund's currency hedging strategy and the costs associated with hedging transactions may also in general be affected by interest rates. significant differences between u.s. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates may further impact the effectiveness of the fund's currency hedging strategy. there can be no assurance that the fund's hedging transactions will be effective. the fund's currency hedging activities will potentially increase or accelerate distributions to shareholders, increase distributions taxed to individuals as ordinary income, result in the re-characterization of prior ordinary income distributions as return of capital, or generate losses that cannot be used to offset income or capital gain in subsequent years. the fund will bear the costs associated with any such hedging transaction, regardless of any gain or loss experienced on the hedging transaction. currency risk: despite the fund's currency hedging strategy, the value of the fund's assets may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates, currency exchange control regulations, and restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign currencies. foreign currency exchange rates may have significant volatility, and changes in the values of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar may result in substantial declines in the values of the fund's, or the portfolio's, assets denominated in foreign currencies. because the fund's, or the portfolio's, net asset values (“navs”) are determined in u.s. dollars, the fund's nav could decline if the currency of a non-u.s. market in which the fund invests depreciates against the u.s. dollar and the fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure is unsuccessful. generally, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against a foreign currency will reduce the value of a security denominated in that foreign currency when measured in u.s. dollars, thereby decreasing the fund's overall nav. a foreign currency may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates, currency control regulations and restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of the foreign currency. fluctuations in the exchange values of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region in which the fund or the portfolio invests, causing an adverse impact on the fund's, or the portfolio's, investments in the affected region and the united states. as a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold fund shares. depositary receipts risk: investments in depositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the underlying securities in their primary trading market. if a depositary receipt is denominated in a different currency than its underlying securities, the fund will be subject to the currency risk of both the investment in the depositary receipt and the underlying security. holders of depositary receipts may have limited or no rights to take action with respect to the underlying securities or to compel the issuer of the receipts to take action. the prices of depositary receipts may differ from the prices of securities upon which they are based. to the extent the fund invests in depositary receipts based on securities included in the index, such differences in prices may increase index tracking risk. derivatives risk: derivative transactions can create investment leverage and may have significant volatility. it is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a much greater loss than the principal amount invested, and the fund may not be able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable time or price. the counterparty to a derivatives contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the fund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. a derivatives transaction may not behave in the manner anticipated by the adviser or may not have the effect on the fund anticipated by the adviser. 4 equity investing risk: the market prices of equity securities owned by the fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. the value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to general industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company. in addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time. financial sector risk: financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation which may limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain. profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition. in addition, deterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets, including u.s. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets. certain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain financial services companies to incur large losses. securities of financial services companies may experience a dramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their assets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or cease operations. credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated with investment activities can negatively impact the sector. insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition. adverse economic, business or political developments could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate. geographic focus risk: the performance of a fund that is less diversified across countries or geographic regions will be closely tied to market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory conditions and developments in the countries or regions in which the fund invests, and may be more volatile than the performance of a more geographically-diversified fund. europe: developed and emerging market countries in europe will be significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary controls of the economic and monetary union of the european union (“eu”). changes in regulations on trade, decreasing imports or exports, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and recessions among european countries may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other european countries. in addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the eu. for example, in june 2016, citizens of the united kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the eu (known as “brexit”), creating economic and political uncertainty in its wake. in march 2017, the united kingdom formally notified the european council of the united kingdom's intention to withdraw from the eu pursuant to article 50 of the treaty on european union. this formal notification began a two-year period of negotiations regarding the terms of the united kingdom's exit from the eu. it is unclear how withdrawal negotiations will be conducted and what the potential consequences may be. any exits from the eu, or the possibility of such exits, may have a significant impact on the united kingdom, europe, and global economies, which may result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal and regulatory uncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for such economies that could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of the fund's investments. in addition, a number of countries in europe have suffered terrorist attacks and additional attacks may occur in the future. such attacks may cause uncertainty in financial markets and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the fund has exposure. japan: the growth of japan's economy has historically lagged that of its asian neighbors and other major developed economies. the japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners. china has become an important trading partner with japan, yet the countries' political relationship has become strained. should political tension increase, it could adversely affect the economy, especially the export sector, and destabilize the region as a whole. japan also remains heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the economy. the japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the japanese economy. japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen. japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors. japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. japan's labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect japan's economic competitiveness. natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur in japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the japanese economy and, in turn, the fund. 5 united kingdom: the united kingdom has one of the largest economies in europe, and the united states and other european countries are substantial trading partners of the united kingdom. as a result, the british economy may be impacted by changes to the economic condition of the united states and other european countries. the british economy, along with certain other eu economies, experienced a significant economic slowdown during the recent financial crisis, and certain british financial institutions suffered significant losses, were severely under-capitalized and required government intervention to survive. the british economy relies heavily on the export of financial services to the united states and other european countries and, therefore, a prolonged slowdown in the financial services sector may have a negative impact on the british economy. continued governmental involvement or control in certain sectors may stifle competition in certain sectors or cause adverse effects on economic growth. indexing strategy/index tracking risk: the fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of the index or of the actual securities comprising the index. this differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. as a result, the fund's performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. the structure and composition of the index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the index and, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the fund. while the adviser seeks to track the performance of the index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the index), the fund's return may not match the return of the index. the fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the index, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. in addition, the fund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the fund or reserves of cash held by the fund to meet redemptions. the adviser may attempt to replicate the index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the index, or in some securities not included in the index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the fund's return and that of the index. large-capitalization securities risk: returns on investments in securities of large companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of smaller and mid-sized companies. larger companies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to competitive challenges or to changes in business, product, financial, or other market conditions. larger companies may not be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may be achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized companies. large shareholder risk: to the extent a large proportion of the shares of the portfolio are held by a small number of shareholders (or a single shareholder), including funds or accounts over which the adviser has investment discretion, the portfolio is subject to the risk that these shareholders will purchase or redeem portfolio shares in large amounts rapidly or unexpectedly, including as a result of an asset allocation decision made by the adviser. these transactions could adversely affect the ability of the portfolio to conduct its investment program. liquidity risk: lack of a ready market or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price or at all. illiquid securities may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. illiquidity of the fund's holdings may limit the ability of the fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. in addition, the fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid securities and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such investments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector. market risk: the fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, and general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets. investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. the fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and markets. mid-capitalization securities risk: the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger companies. these companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, may lack the competitive strength of larger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. in addition, these companies may have been recently organized and may have little or no track record of success. the securities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. some securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale, and their values may be volatile. non-u.s. securities risk: non-u.s. securities (including depositary receipts) are subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic investments. there may be less information publicly available about a non-u.s. entity than about a u.s. entity, and many non-u.s. entities are not subject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report standards comparable 6 to those in the united states. further, such entities and/or their securities may be subject to risks associated with currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market volatility; differing securities market structures; higher transaction costs; and various administrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of dividends. securities traded on foreign markets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded domestically. foreign governments may impose restrictions on the repatriation of capital to the u.s. in addition, to the extent that the fund buys securities denominated in a foreign currency, there are special risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign government could regulate foreign exchange transactions. in addition, to the extent investments are made in a limited number of countries, events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the fund. investments in depositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. risk of investment in other pools: when the fund invests in another pooled investment vehicle, it is exposed to the risk that the other pool will not perform as expected and is exposed indirectly to all of the risks applicable to an investment in such other pool. the investment policies of the other pool may not be the same as those of the fund; as a result, an investment in the other pool may be subject to additional or different risks than those to which the fund is typically subject. the fund bears its proportionate share of the fees and expenses of any pool in which it invests. the adviser or an affiliate may serve as investment adviser to a pool in which the fund may invest, leading to potential conflicts of interest. it is possible that other clients of the adviser or its affiliates will purchase or sell interests in a pool sponsored or managed by the adviser or its affiliates at prices and at times more favorable than those at which the fund does so. underlying fund risk: the fund currently intends to gain all of its investment exposure to, and track the performance of, the index constituents by investing in another pooled investment vehicle (an “underlying fund”). the ability of the fund to meet its investment objective with respect to the index constituents is directly related to the ability of the underlying fund to meet its investment objective. the adviser serves as investment adviser to the underlying fund, leading to potential conflicts of interest. the fund will bear its pro rata portion of the expenses incurred by the underlying fund. substantial redemptions by other investors in an underlying fund may affect the underlying fund's investment program adversely and limit the ability of the underlying fund to achieve its objective. valuation risk: some portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. this may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. there are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available. the value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations. portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including “fair valued” securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used. in addition, there is no assurance that the fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the fund at that time. investors who purchase or redeem fund shares on days when the fund is holding fair-valued investments may receive fewer or more shares or lower or higher redemption proceeds than they would have received if the fund had not fair-valued the holding(s) or had used a different valuation methodology.",while the adviser seeks to track the performance of the index ( i.e.,i.e.
10,25865,25865,0000930413-13-000284,2013,market vectors rare earth/strategic metals etf,"of investing in the fund investors in the fund should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility in the price of the fund’s shares and the possibility of significant losses. an investment in the fund involves a substantial degree of risk. an investment in the fund is not a deposit with a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency. therefore, you should consider carefully the following risks before investing in the fund. risk of investing in rare earth and strategic metals. rare earth/strategic metals are industrial metals that are typically mined as by-products or secondary metals in operations focused on precious metals and base metals. compared to base metals, they have more specialized uses and are often more difficult to extract. currently, approximately 49 elements in the periodic table are considered rare earth/strategic metals. rare earth metals (or rare earth elements), a subset of strategic metals, are a collection of chemical elements that are crucial to many of the world’s most advanced technologies. the use of strategic metals in modern technology has increased dramatically over the past years. consequently, the demand for strategic metals has strained the supply, which has the potential to result in a shortage of such materials which could adversely affect the companies in the fund’s portfolio. companies involved in the various activities that are related to the producing, refining and recycling of rare earth/strategic metals tend to be small-, medium- and micro-capitalization companies with volatile share prices, are highly dependent on the price of rare earth/strategic metals which may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time and can be significantly affected by events relating to international, national and local political and economic developments, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, commodity prices, and tax and other government regulations. the producing, refining and recycling of rare earth/strategic metals can be capital intensive and, if companies involved in such activities are not managed well, the share prices of such companies could decline even as prices for the underlying rare earth/strategic metals are rising. in addition, companies involved in the various activities that are related to the producing, refining and recycling of rare earth/strategic metals may be at risk for environmental damage claims. risk of regulatory action and changes in governments. the producing, refining and recycling of rare earth/strategic metals may be significantly affected by regulatory action and changes in governments. for example, china, which produces more than 90% of the world’s rare earth supplies, has implemented a reduction in its export quota of rare earth/strategic metals and has considered a complete ban on the export of such metals. such moves could have a significant adverse effect on industries around the globe and on the values of the businesses in which the fund expect to invest. moreover, while it is expected that china will consume most if not all, of the rare earth/strategic metals produced within the country to support its growing economy, china has shown a willingness to flood the market for rare earth/strategic metals as it did in the late 1990s, thereby causing many operations to shut down. 2 vaneck.com risk of investing in the mining industry. because the fund invests in stocks and depositary receipts of u.s. and foreign companies that are involved in mining, it is subject to certain risks associated with such companies in the mining industry. competitive pressures may have a significant effect on the financial condition of such companies. mining companies are highly dependent on the price of the underlying metal or element. these prices may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time so the fund’s share price may be more volatile than other types of investments. in particular, a drop in the price of rare earth/strategic metals would particularly adversely affect the profitability of small- and medium-capitalization mining companies and their ability to secure financing. furthermore, companies that are only in the exploration stage are typically unable to adopt specific strategies for controlling the impact of such price changes. in addition, many early stage miners operate at a loss and are dependent on securing equity and/or debt financing, which might be more difficult to secure for an early stage mining company than for a more established counterpart. risk of investing in foreign issuers. investments in the securities of non-u.s. issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in u.s. securities. these additional risks include greater market volatility, the availability of less reliable financial information, higher transactional and custody costs, taxation by foreign governments, decreased market liquidity and political instability. because the fund may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies and some of the income received by the fund will generally be in foreign currencies, changes in currency exchange rates may negatively impact the fund’s return. in addition, the fund may invest in depositary receipts which involve similar risks to those associated with investments in foreign securities. risk of investing in emerging market issuers. investments in securities of emerging market issuers are exposed to a number of risks that may make these investments volatile in price or difficult to trade. political risks may include unstable governments, nationalization, restrictions on foreign ownership, laws that prevent investors from getting their money out of a country and legal systems that do not protect property rights as well as the laws of the united states. market risks may include economies that concentrate in only a few industries, securities issues that are held by only a few investors, limited trading capacity in local exchanges and the possibility that markets or issues may be manipulated by foreign nationals who have inside information. risk of investing in depositary receipts. depositary receipts in which the fund may invest are receipts issued by banks or trust companies and entitle the holder to all dividends and capital gains that are paid out on the underlying foreign shares. investments in depositary receipts may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market and (if not included in the rare earth/strategic metals index) may negatively affect the fund’s ability to replicate the performance of the rare earth/strategic metals index. risk of investing in small- and medium-capitalization companies. small- and medium-capitalization companies may be more volatile and more likely than large-capitalization companies to have narrower product lines, fewer financial resources, less management depth and experience and less competitive strength. returns on investments in stocks of small-capitalization and medium-capitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in stocks of large-capitalization companies. risk of investing in micro-capitalization companies. micro-capitalization companies are subject to substantially greater risks of loss and price fluctuations because their earnings and revenues tend to be less predictable (and some companies may be experiencing significant losses), and their share prices tend to be more volatile and their markets less liquid than companies with larger market capitalizations. the shares of micro-capitalization companies tend to trade less frequently than those of larger, more established companies, which can adversely affect the pricing of these securities and the future ability to sell these securities. market risk. the prices of the securities in the fund are subject to the risks associated with investing in the securities market, including general economic conditions and sudden and unpredictable drops in value. an investment in the fund may lose money. index tracking risk. the fund’s return may not match the return of the rare earth/strategic metals index for a number of reasons. for example, the fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the rare earth/strategic metals index and incurs costs associated with buying and selling securities, especially when rebalancing the fund’s securities holdings to reflect changes in the composition of the rare earth/strategic metals index. because the fund bears the costs and risks associated with buying and selling securities while such costs and risks are not factored into the return of the rare earth/strategic metals index, the fund’s return may deviate significantly from the return of the rare earth/strategic metals index. in addition, the fund may not be able to invest in certain securities included in the rare earth/strategic metals index, or invest in them in the exact proportions they represent of the rare earth/strategic metals index, due to legal restrictions or limitations imposed by the governments of certain countries or a lack of liquidity on stock exchanges in which such securities trade. the fund is expected to value certain of its investments based on fair value prices. to the extent the fund calculates its nav based on fair value prices and the value of the rare earth/strategic metals index is based on securities’ closing prices on local foreign markets ( i.e. , the value of the rare earth/strategic metals index is not based on fair value prices), the fund’s ability to track the rare earth/strategic metals index may be adversely affected. replication management risk. an investment in the fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund of equity securities traded on an exchange, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in security prices. however, because the fund is not “actively” managed, unless a vaneck.com 3 specific security is removed from the rare earth/strategic metals index, the fund generally would not sell a security because the security’s issuer was in financial trouble. therefore, the fund’s performance could be lower than other types of mutual funds that may actively shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or to lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers. non-diversified risk. the fund is classified as a “non-diversified” investment company under the 1940 act. therefore, the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a smaller number of issuers or may invest a larger proportion of its assets in a single company. as a result, the gains and losses on a single investment may have a greater impact on the fund’s nav and may make the fund more volatile than more diversified funds. the fund may be particularly vulnerable to this risk because the rare earth/strategic metals index it seeks to replicate is comprised of securities of a very limited number of companies. concentration risk. the fund’s assets may be concentrated in a particular sector or sectors or industry or group of industries to the extent the rare earth/strategic metals index concentrates in a particular sector or sectors or industry or group of industries. based on the current composition of the rare earth/strategic metals index, it is expected that the fund’s assets will be concentrated in the mining industry and that the fund will be subject to the risk that economic, political or other conditions that have a negative effect on that industry will negatively impact the fund to a greater extent than if the fund’s assets were invested in a wider variety of sectors or industries. risk of investing in the materials sub-industry. to the extent the rare earth/strategic metals index includes securities of issuers in the materials sub-industry of the strategic metals industry, the fund will invest in companies in such sub-industry. companies in the materials sub-industry of the strategic metals industry may be adversely affected by changes in world events, political and economic conditions, energy conservation, environmental policies, commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources and labor relations.",to the extent the fund calculates its nav based on fair value prices and the value of the rare earth/strategic metals index is based on securities closing prices on local foreign markets ( i.e.,i.e.

expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. this example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses\n            or returns, all of which may vary. this example does not include any fees or other expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product; if it\n            did, overall expenses would be higher. for every $10,000 invested, here\'s how much you, as a variable product owner, would pay in total expenses if all interests\n            in a separate account that invests in

section of the prospectus because of\n                  acquired fund fees and expenses.  \n          (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; fidelity management & research company llc (fmr) has contractually agreed to waive 0.05% of the fund\'s management fee. this\n               arrangement will remain in effect through april 30, 2021. in addition, fmr has contractually agreed to reimburse 0.10% of class-level expenses for service class and\n                  service class 2. this arrangement will remain in effect for at least one year from the effective date of the prospectus, and\n                  will remain in effect thereafter as long as service class and service class 2 continue to be sold to unaffiliated insurance\n                  companies. if service class and service class 2 are no longer sold to unaffiliated insurance companies, fmr, in its sole discretion,\n               may discontinue the arrangement.  \n          this  example  helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds.\n          \n          let\'s say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that the fees and the annual operating\n            expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. this example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses\n            or returns, all of which may vary. this example does not include any fees or other expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product; if it\n            did, overall expenses would be higher. for every $10,000 invested, here\'s how much you, as a variable product owner, would pay in total expenses if all interests\n            in a separate account that invests in shares of the fund were redeemed at the end of each time period indicated:\n          \n          \n             \n                &nbsp; \n                service class&nbsp; \n

not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying fidelity &#174;  funds (or ""turns over"" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities\n            directly. if the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher\n            transaction costs. such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would\n            affect the fund\'s performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund\'s portfolio turnover rate was 33% of the average value of its portfolio.\n           \n             principal investment strategies   \n             normally investing in a combination

will not meet their investment objectives.\n             \n          \n          \n              stock market volatility. &nbsp;\n               stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or\n               economic developments. different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities\n               can react differently to these developments.\n             \n          \n          \n              interest rate changes. &nbsp;\n               interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\n             \n          \n          \n              foreign exposure. &nbsp;\n               foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the u.s. market due to increased risks of adverse\n               issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the u.s. market. emerging markets can be subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties and can be extremely\n               volatile. foreign exchange rates also can be extremely volatile.\n             \n          \n          \n                geographic exposure.   &nbsp;\n               social, political, and economic conditions and changes in regulatory, tax, or economic policy in a country or region could\n               significantly affect the market in that country or region.\n             \n          \n          \n              industry exposure. &nbsp;\n               market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single\n               industry or group of related industries.\n             \n          \n          \n              prepayment. &nbsp;\n               the ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security\'s maturity can cause greater price volatility\n               if interest rates change.\n             \n          \n          \n              issuer-specific changes. &nbsp;\n               the value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently\n               from, the market as a whole. a decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security\n               can cause the price of a security to decrease. lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities\n               or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the\n               credit quality of the issuer. the value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more\n               volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can be\n               difficult to resell.\n             \n          \n          \n              leverage risk. &nbsp;\n               leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\n             \n          \n          \n

by reference into this summary prospectus. the fund's sai may be obtained, free of charge, in the same manner as the prospectus. investment objective the fund seeks current income exempt from regular federal income tax. fees and expenses these tables are intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses you will pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. shareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment) maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) none maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of offering price) none annual fund operating expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) management fees 0.35% distribution (12b-1) fees 0.00% other expenses 0.43% total annual fund operating expenses 0.78% fee waivers 0.10% total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver 1 0.68% 1. the adviser has committed through july 11, 2013 to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to cap the fund's total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver, excluding certain expenses, at the amount shown above. after this time, such cap may be changed or the commitment to maintain the cap may be terminated only with the approval of the board of trustees. example of expenses the example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. the example assumes a $10,000 initial investment, 5% annual total return, and that operating expenses remain the same as in the tables above. the example also assumes that the total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver shown above will only be in place for the length of the current waiver commitment. although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: after: 1 year $69 3 years $229 5 years $413 10 years $947 portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 12% of the average value of its portfolio. principal investment strategies under normal circumstances, we invest at least 80% of the fund's net assets in municipal securities that pay interest exempt from regular federal income tax, but not necessarily the federal alternative minimum tax (amt). we invest up to 35% of the fund's total assets in below investment-grade municipal securities. we may also invest any amount in securities that pay interest subject to federal amt. we invest principally in municipal securities of states, territories and possessions of the united states that pay interest exempt from regular federal income tax, but not necessarily federal amt. some of the securities may be below investment grade or may be unrated and deemed by us to be of comparable quality. we may also invest any amount of the fund's total assets in securities that pay interest subject to federal amt. we may use futures for duration and yield curve management. we start our investment process with a top-down, macroeconomic outlook to determine portfolio duration and yield curve positioning as well as industry, sector and credit quality allocations. macroeconomic factors considered may include, among others, the pace of economic growth, employment conditions, inflation, and monetary and fiscal policy. in combination with our top-down macroeconomic approach, we conduct intensive research on individual issuers to uncover solid investment opportunities, especially looking for bonds whose quality may be improving. our security selection is based on several factors including, among others, improving financial trends, positive industry and sector dynamics, improving economic conditions, specific demographic trends and value relative to other securities. we may sell a security due to changes in credit characteristics or outlook, as well as changes in portfolio strategy or cash flow needs. a security may also be sold based on relative value considerations and could be replaced with a security that presents a better value or risk/reward profile. principal investment risks an investment in the fund is not a deposit of

administrator class ticker: vmpyx summary prospectus november 1, 2011 link to prospectus link to sai before you invest, you may want to review the fund's prospectus, which contains more information about the fund and its risks. you can find the fund's prospectus and other information about the fund online at www.wellsfargo.com/advantagefunds. you can also get information at no cost by calling 1-800-222-8222, or by sending an email request to wfaf@wellsfargo.com. the current prospectus (""prospectus"") and statement of additional information (""sai), dated november 1, 2011, are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus. the fund's sai may be obtained, free of charge, in the same manner as the prospectus. investment objective the fund seeks current income exempt from regular federal income tax. fees and expenses these tables are intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses you will pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. shareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment) maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) none maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of offering price) none annual fund operating expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) management fees 0.35% distribution (12b-1) fees 0.00% other expenses 0.43% total annual fund operating expenses 0.78% fee waivers 0.10% total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver 1 0.68% 1. the adviser has committed through july 11, 2013 to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to cap the fund's total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver, excluding certain expenses, at the amount shown above. after this time, such cap may be changed or the commitment to maintain the cap may be terminated only with the approval of the board of trustees. example of expenses the example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. the example assumes a $10,000 initial investment, 5% annual total return, and that operating expenses remain the same as in the tables above. the example also assumes that the total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver shown above will only be in place for the length of the current waiver commitment. although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: after: 1 year $69 3 years $229 5 years $413 10 years $947 portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 12% of the average value of its portfolio. principal investment strategies under normal circumstances, we invest at least 80% of the fund's net assets in municipal securities that pay interest exempt from regular federal income tax, but not necessarily the federal alternative minimum tax (amt). we invest up to 35% of the fund's total assets in below investment-grade municipal securities. we may also invest any amount in securities that pay interest subject to federal amt. we invest principally in municipal securities of states, territories and possessions of the united states that pay interest exempt from regular federal income tax, but not necessarily federal amt. some of the securities may be below investment grade or may be unrated and deemed by us to be of comparable quality. we may also invest any amount of the fund's total assets in securities that pay interest subject to federal amt. we may use futures for duration and yield curve management. we start our investment process with a top-down, macroeconomic outlook to determine portfolio duration and yield curve positioning as well as industry, sector and credit quality allocations. macroeconomic factors considered may include, among others, the pace of economic growth, employment conditions, inflation, and monetary and fiscal policy. in combination with our top-down macroeconomic approach, we conduct intensive research on individual issuers to uncover solid investment opportunities, especially looking for bonds whose quality may be improving. our security selection is based on several factors including, among others, improving financial trends, positive industry and sector dynamics, improving economic conditions, specific demographic trends and value relative to other securities. we may sell a security due to changes in credit characteristics or outlook, as well as changes in portfolio strategy or cash flow needs. a security may also be sold based on relative value considerations and could be replaced with a security that presents a better value or risk/reward profile. principal investment risks an investment in the fund is not a deposit of wells fargo bank, n.a. or its affiliates and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency. counter-party risk. a fund may incur a loss if the other party to an investment contract, such as a derivative or a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement, fails to fulfill its contractual obligation to the fund. debt securities risk. the issuer of a debt security may fail to pay interest or principal when due, and changes in market interest rates may reduce the value of debt securities or reduce the fund's returns. derivatives risk. the use of derivatives such as futures, options and swap agreements, can lead to losses, including those magnified by leverage, particularly when derivatives are used to enhance return rather than offset risk. futures risk. because the futures utilized by a fund are standardized and exchange-traded, where the exchange serves as the ultimate counterparty for all contracts, the primary credit risk on futures contracts is the creditworthiness of the exchange itself. futures are also subject to market risk, interest rate risk (in the case of futures contracts relating to income producing securities) and index tracking risk (in the case of stock index futures). high yield securities risk. high yield securities, i.e. ""junk bonds,"" are debt securities that are rated below investment-grade, are unrated and deemed by us to be below investment-grade, or are in default at the time of purchase. these securities have a much greater risk of default or of not returning principal and tend to be more volatile than higher-rated securities of similar maturity. leverage risk. leverage created by borrowing or certain investments, such as derivatives and reverse repurchase agreements, can diminish the fund's performance and increase the volatility of the fund's net asset value. liquidity risk. a security may not be able to be sold at the time desired or without adversely affecting the price. management risk. there is no guarantee of the fund's performance or that the fund will meet its objective. the market value of your investment may decline and you may suffer investment loss. market risk. the market price of securities owned by the fund may rapidly or unpredictably decline due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular

more of its total assets in municipal securities that are related in such a way that political, economic or business developments affecting one obligation would affect the others. tax authorities are

portion of the fund's distributions may not qualify as exempt-interest dividends; such distributions will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account. you should consult your tax adviser about your specific situation. payments to broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries if you purchase a fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. these payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment. consult your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's web site for more information. link to prospectus link to sai strategic municipal bond fund summary class/ticker:

by reference into this summary prospectus. the fund's sai may be obtained, free of charge, in the same manner as the prospectus. investment objective the fund seeks current income exempt from regular federal income tax. fees and expenses these tables are intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses you will pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. shareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment) maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) none maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of offering price) none annual fund operating expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) management fees 0.35% distribution (12b-1) fees 0.00% other expenses 0.43% total annual fund operating expenses 0.78% fee waivers 0.10% total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver 1 0.68% 1. the adviser has committed through july 11, 2013 to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to cap the fund's total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver, excluding certain expenses, at the amount shown above. after this time, such cap may be changed or the commitment to maintain the cap may be terminated only with the approval of the board of trustees. example of expenses the example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. the example assumes a $10,000 initial investment, 5% annual total return, and that operating expenses remain the same as in the tables above. the example also assumes that the total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver shown above will only be in place for the length of the current waiver commitment. although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: after: 1 year $69 3 years $229 5 years $413 10 years $947 portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. during the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 12% of the average value of its portfolio. principal investment strategies under normal circumstances, we invest at least 80% of the fund's net assets in municipal securities that pay interest exempt from regular federal income tax, but not necessarily the federal alternative minimum tax (amt). we invest up to 35% of the fund's total assets in below investment-grade municipal securities. we may also invest any amount in securities that pay interest subject to federal amt. we invest principally in municipal securities of states, territories and possessions of the united states that pay interest exempt from regular federal income tax, but not necessarily federal amt. some of the securities may be below investment grade or may be unrated and deemed by us to be of comparable quality. we may also invest any amount of the fund's total assets in securities that pay interest subject to federal amt. we may use futures for duration and yield curve management. we start our investment process with a top-down, macroeconomic outlook to determine portfolio duration and yield curve positioning as well as industry, sector and credit quality allocations. macroeconomic factors considered may include, among others, the pace of economic growth, employment conditions, inflation, and monetary and fiscal policy. in combination with our top-down macroeconomic approach, we conduct intensive research on individual issuers to uncover solid investment opportunities, especially looking for bonds whose quality may be improving. our security selection is based on several factors including, among others, improving financial trends, positive industry and sector dynamics, improving economic conditions, specific demographic trends and value relative to other securities. we may sell a security due to changes in credit characteristics or outlook, as well as changes in portfolio strategy or cash flow needs. a security may also be sold based on relative value considerations and could be replaced with a security that presents a better value or risk/reward profile. principal investment risks an investment in the fund is not a deposit of wells fargo bank, n.a. or its affiliates and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency. counter-party risk. a fund may incur a loss if the other party to an investment contract, such as a derivative or a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement, fails to fulfill its contractual obligation to the fund. debt securities risk. the issuer of a debt security may fail to pay interest or principal when due, and changes in market interest rates may reduce the value of debt securities or reduce the fund's returns. derivatives risk. the use of derivatives such as futures, options and swap agreements, can lead to losses, including those magnified by leverage, particularly when derivatives are used to enhance return rather than offset risk. futures risk. because the futures utilized by a fund are standardized and exchange-traded, where the exchange serves as the ultimate counterparty for all contracts, the primary credit risk on futures contracts is the creditworthiness of the exchange itself. futures are also subject to market risk, interest rate risk (in the case of futures contracts relating to income producing securities) and index tracking risk (in the case of stock index futures). high yield securities risk. high yield securities, i.e. ""junk bonds,"" are debt securities that are rated below investment-grade, are unrated and deemed by us to be below investment-grade, or are in default at the time of purchase. these securities have a much greater risk of default or of not returning principal and tend to be more volatile than higher-rated securities of similar maturity. leverage risk. leverage created by borrowing or certain investments, such as derivatives and reverse repurchase agreements, can diminish the fund's performance and increase the volatility of the fund's net asset value. liquidity risk. a security may not be able to be sold at the time desired or without adversely affecting the price. management risk. there is no guarantee of the fund's performance or that the fund will meet its objective. the market value of your investment may decline and you may suffer investment loss. market risk. the market price of securities owned by the fund may rapidly or unpredictably decline due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries. municipal securities risk. municipal securities rely on the creditworthiness or revenue production of their issuers or auxiliary credit enhancement features. the fund may invest 25% or more of its total assets in municipal securities that are related in such a way that political, economic or business developments affecting one obligation would affect the others. tax authorities are paying increased attention as to whether interest on municipal obligations is tax exempt, and we cannot assure you that a tax authority will not successfully challenge the exemption of a bond held by the fund. the ongoing issues facing the national economy are negatively impacting the economic performance of many issuers of municipal securities, and may increase the likelihood that issuers of securities in which the fund may invest may be unable to meet their obligations. regulatory risk. changes in government regulations may adversely affect the value of a security. an insufficiently regulated industry or market might also permit inappropriate practices that adversely affect an investment. performance the following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the fund by showing changes in the fund's performance from year to year. the fund's average annual total returns are compared to the performance of an appropriate broad-based index(es).","high yield

19,76510,76510,0001104659-18-028670,2018,vp conservative strategy fund,"the success of the fund's investment strategy depends on simc's allocation of assets among the underlying sei funds and its selection of other investment companies, etps and derivative instruments in which to invest that portion of the fund's assets not allocated to the underlying sei funds. in managing the fund, simc may be incorrect in assessing market trends or the value or growth capability of particular asset classes or other investments. in addition, the methodology by which simc allocates the fund's assets among the underlying sei funds and other investments may not achieve desired results and may cause the fund to lose money or underperform other comparable mutual funds. the underlying sei funds and other investment companies and etps in which the fund invests may apply any of a variety of investment strategies and may invest in a broad range of asset classes, securities and other investments to attempt to achieve their designated investment goals. the principal risks of the fund as a result of its investments in the underlying sei funds and other investment companies, etps or other investments are set forth below. asset allocation risk — the risk that simc's decisions regarding asset classes and underlying sei funds will not anticipate market trends successfully. below investment grade securities (junk bonds) risk — fixed income securities rated below investment grade (junk bonds) involve greater risk of default or downgrade and are generally more volatile than investment grade securities because the prospect for repayment of principal and interest of many of these securities is speculative. because these securities typically offer a higher rate of return to compensate for these risks, they are sometimes referred to as ""high yield bonds,"" but there is no guarantee that an investment in these securities will result in a high rate of return. commodity investments risk — certain underlying sei funds may invest a portion of their assets in a wholly owned subsidiary that is not registered under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (1940 act), and invests directly in commodities and commodity-related instruments. other underlying sei funds may have indirect exposure to commodities by investing in commodity-related instruments. commodity investments and derivatives may be more volatile and less liquid than direct investments in the underlying commodities themselves. commodity-related equity returns can also be affected by the issuer's financial structure or the performance of unrelated businesses. the value of a commodity investment or a derivative investment in commodities is typically based upon the price movements of a physical commodity, a commodity futures contract or commodity index or some other readily measurable economic variable that is dependent upon changes in the value of commodities or the commodities markets. the value of these securities will rise or fall in response to changes in the underlying commodity or related benchmark or investment, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as natural disasters, weather and u.s. and international economic, political and regulatory developments. currency risk — as a result of the fund's and certain underlying sei funds' investments in securities or other investments denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies, the fund will be subject to currency risk. currency risk is the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the u.s. dollar or, in the case of hedging positions, that the u.s. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency hedged. in either event, the dollar value of an investment in the fund or an underlying sei fund would be adversely affected. currency exchange rates may fluctuate in response to, among other things, changes in interest rates, intervention (or failure to intervene) by u.s. or foreign governments, central banks or supranational entities, or by the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the united states or abroad. derivatives risk — the use of futures contracts, forward contracts, options and swaps is subject to market risk, leverage risk, correlation risk and liquidity risk. many over-the-counter (otc) derivative instruments will not have liquidity beyond the counterparty to the instrument. market risk is the risk that the market value of an investment may move up and down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. leverage risk is the risk that a small percentage of assets invested in a derivative can have a disproportionately larger impact on the fund's or an underlying sei fund's performance. correlation risk is the risk that changes in the value of a derivative instrument may not correlate perfectly with changes in the value of the derivative instrument's underlying asset, rate or index. liquidity risk is the risk that the derivative may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time and the price that the fund or an underlying sei fund would like, which may cause the fund or the underlying sei fund to have to lower the selling price, sell other securities instead or forego an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on the fund's or the underlying sei fund's management or performance. the use of swaps and forward contracts and options is also subject to credit risk and valuation risk. credit risk is the risk that the issuer of a security or counterparty to a derivatives contract will default or otherwise become unable to honor its financial obligation to 3 sei / summary prospectus the fund or the underlying sei fund under the contract. valuation risk is the risk that the derivative may be difficult to value and/or valued incorrectly. each of the above risks could cause the fund or an underlying sei fund to lose more than the principal amount invested in a derivative instrument. some derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the fund's or an underlying sei fund's initial investment. the other parties to certain derivative contracts present the same types of credit risk as issuers of fixed income securities. the fund's or an underlying sei fund's use of derivatives may also increase the amount of taxes payable by some shareholders. both u.s. and non-u.s. regulators are in the process of adopting and implementing regulations governing derivatives markets, the ultimate impact of which remains unclear. equity market risk — the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time. exchange-traded products (etps) risk — the risks of owning interests of an etp, such as an etf, etn or exchange-traded commodity pool, generally reflect the same risks as owning the underlying securities or other instruments that the etp is designed to track. the shares of certain etps may trade at a premium or discount to their intrinsic value ( i.e. , the market value may differ from the net asset value (nav) of an etp's shares). for example, supply and demand for shares of an etf or market disruptions may cause the market price of the etf to deviate from the value of the etf's investments, which may be emphasized in less liquid markets. the value of an etn may also differ from the valuation of its reference market or instrument due to changes in the issuer's credit rating. by investing in an etp, the fund or an underlying sei fund indirectly bears the proportionate share of any fees and expenses of the etp in addition to the fees and expenses that the fund and its shareholders directly bear in connection with the fund's operations. because certain etps may have a significant portion of their assets exposed directly or indirectly to commodities or commodity-linked securities, developments affecting commodities may have a disproportionate impact on such etps and may subject the etps to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. fixed income market risk — the prices of fixed income securities respond to economic developments, particularly interest rate changes, as well as to perceptions about the creditworthiness of individual issuers, including governments and their agencies. generally, an underlying sei fund's fixed income securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and vice versa. in a low interest rate environment, risks associated with rising rates are heightened. declines in dealer market-making capacity as a result of structural or regulatory changes could decrease liquidity and/or increase volatility in the fixed income markets. in the case of foreign securities, price fluctuations will reflect international economic and political events, as well as changes in currency valuations relative to the u.s. dollar. in response to these events, the underlying sei fund's and, in turn, the fund's value may fluctuate and/or the underlying sei fund and the fund may experience increased redemptions from shareholders, which may impact the underlying sei fund's and the fund's liquidity or force the underlying sei fund and the fund to sell securities into a declining or illiquid market. foreign investment/emerging markets risk — the risk that non-u.s. securities may be subject to additional risks due to, among other things, political, social and economic developments abroad, currency movements, and different legal, regulatory and tax environments. these additional risks may be heightened with respect to emerging market countries because political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions are more likely to occur in these countries. investment company risk — when the fund or an underlying sei fund invests in an investment company, in addition to directly bearing the expenses associated with its own operations, it will bear a pro rata portion of the investment company's expenses. in addition, while the risks of owning shares of an investment company generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying investments of the investment company, the fund may be subject to additional or different risks than if the fund or an underlying sei fund had invested directly in the underlying investments. real estate industry risk — securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate industry may be subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate. risks commonly associated with the direct ownership of real estate include fluctuations in the value of underlying properties, defaults by borrowers or tenants, changes in interest rates and risks related to general or local economic conditions. short sales risk — a short sale involves the sale of a security that a fund does not own in the expectation of purchasing the same security (or a security exchangeable therefore) at a later date at a lower price. short sales entered into by an underlying sei fund expose the fund to the risk that the underlying sei fund will be required to buy a security sold short (also known as ""covering"" the short position) at a time when the security has appreciated in value, thus resulting in a loss to the underlying sei fund and, therefore, the fund, that is potentially unlimited. reinvesting proceeds received from short selling may create leverage, which can amplify the effects of market volatility on the share price of an underlying sei fund and, therefore, the fund. investment in short sales may also cause an underlying sei fund to incur expenses related to borrowing securities. in addition, shorting a future contract may require posting only a margin that may amount to less than the notional exposure of the contract. such a practice may exacerbate the loss in a case of adverse price action. 4 sei / summary prospectus small and medium capitalization risk — small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. in particular, small and medium capitalization companies may have limited product lines, markets and financial resources and may depend upon a relatively small management group. therefore, small and medium capitalization stocks may be more volatile than those of larger companies. small and medium capitalization stocks may be traded over-the-counter or listed on an exchange. u.s. government securities risk — although u.s. government securities are considered to be among the safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to changing interest rates. obligations issued by some u.s. government agencies are backed by the u.s. treasury, while others are backed solely by the ability of the agency to borrow from the u.s. treasury or by the agency's own resources. investing in the fund involves risk, and there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its investment goal. you could lose money on your investment in the fund, just as you could with other investments. an investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency.",the shares of certain etps may trade at a premium or discount to their intrinsic value ( i.e.,i.e.
