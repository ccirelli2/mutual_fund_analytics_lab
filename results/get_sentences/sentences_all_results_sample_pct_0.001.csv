3592,0001193125-13-460513,"depositary receipts risk  the issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the united states, considered material.",166
3593,0001193125-13-460513,"therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts.",183
3594,0001193125-13-460513,depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted.,141
3595,0001193125-13-460513,derivatives risk  the funds use of derivatives may reduce the funds returns and/or increase volatility.,103
3596,0001193125-13-460513,"volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period.",143
3597,0001193125-13-460513,a risk of the funds use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets.,144
3598,0001193125-13-460513,"derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation.",153
3599,0001193125-13-460513,the possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the fund to value accurately.,260
3600,0001193125-13-460513,valuation may be more difficult in times of market turmoil since many investors and market makers may be reluctant to purchase complex instruments or quote prices for them.,172
3601,0001193125-13-460513,derivatives also may expose the fund to greater risk and increase its costs.,76
3602,0001193125-13-460513,certain transactions in derivatives involve substantial leverage risk and may expose the fund to potential losses that exceed the amount originally invested by the fund.,169
3603,0001193125-13-460513,recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets.,71
3604,0001193125-13-460513,the extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time.,92
3605,0001193125-13-460513,"new regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.",166
3606,0001193125-13-460513,"certain aspects of the tax treatment of derivative instruments, including swap agreements, are currently unclear and may be affected by changes in legislation, regulations or other legally binding authority that could affect the character, timing and amount of the funds taxable income or gains and distributions.",313
3607,0001193125-13-460513,risks specific to certain derivatives used by the fund swaps  swap agreements are two-party contracts entered into for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than one year.,174
3608,0001193125-13-460513,"in a standard swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments, which can be adjusted for an interest factor.",232
3609,0001193125-13-460513,swap agreements involve the risk that the party with whom the fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to pay the fund and the risk that the fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.,248
3610,0001193125-13-460513,"the income tax treatment of swap agreements is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the internal revenue service.",182

3612,0001193125-13-460513,forward foreign currency exchange contracts  forward foreign exchange transactions are over-the-counter contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of a specified currency or multinational currency unit at a price and future date set at the time of the contract.,267
3613,0001193125-13-460513,forward foreign currency exchange contracts do not eliminate fluctuations in the value of non-u.s. securities but rather allow the fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time.,201
3614,0001193125-13-460513,this strategy can have the effect of reducing returns and minimizing opportunities for gain.,92
3615,0001193125-13-460513,"contracts for difference  contracts for difference are subject to liquidity risk because the liquidity of contracts for difference is based on the liquidity of the underlying instrument, and are subject to counterparty risk, i.e., the risk that the counterparty to the contracts for difference transaction may be unable or unwilling to make payments or to otherwise honor its financial obligations under the terms of the contract.",430
3616,0001193125-13-460513,"to the extent that there is an imperfect correlation between the return on the funds obligation to its counterparty under the contract for difference and the return on related assets in its portfolio, the contracts for difference transaction may increase the funds financial risk.",280
3617,0001193125-13-460513,"contracts for difference, like many other derivative instruments, involve the risk that, if the derivative security declines in value, additional margin would be required to maintain the margin level.",200
3618,0001193125-13-460513,"the seller may require the fund to deposit additional sums to cover this, and this may be at short notice.",106
3619,0001193125-13-460513,"if additional margin is not provided in time, the seller may liquidate the positions at a loss for which the fund is liable.",124

3622,0001193125-13-460513,emerging markets risk  emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop.,146
3623,0001193125-13-460513,investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative.,62

3626,0001193125-13-460513,equity securities risk  stock markets are volatile.,51
3627,0001193125-13-460513,the price of an equity security fluctuates based on changes in a companys financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.,137
3628,0001193125-13-460513,foreign securities risk  foreign investments often involve special risks not present in u.s. investments that can increase the chances that the fund will lose money.,165
3629,0001193125-13-460513,"these risks include:  the fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.",258
3630,0001193125-13-460513,changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the funds portfolio.,87

3634,0001193125-13-460513,settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of u.s. investments.,200
3635,0001193125-13-460513,high portfolio turnover risk  the fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its investments.,100
3636,0001193125-13-460513,"high portfolio turnover may result in increased transaction costs to the fund, which may be mitigated to the extent such turnover is of certain types of derivative instruments.",176
3637,0001193125-13-460513,it may also result in a change in the funds market exposure over short periods of time.,87
3638,0001193125-13-460513,high portfolio turnover may also result in the realization and distribution to shareholders of higher gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies and could increase an investors tax liability unless shares are held through a tax-deferred or exempt vehicle.,284
3639,0001193125-13-460513,these effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect fund performance.,93
3640,0001193125-13-460513,leverage risk  some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage.,78
3641,0001193125-13-460513,"these transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the fund to greater risk and increase its costs.",122

3643,0001193125-13-460513,"in accordance with these laws, rules and positions, the fund must set aside liquid assets (often referred to as asset segregation), or engage in other sec- or staff-approved measures, to cover open positions with respect to certain kinds of instruments.",253
3644,0001193125-13-460513,the use of leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements.,195
3645,0001193125-13-460513,increases and decreases in the value of the funds portfolio will be magnified when the fund uses leverage.,106
3646,0001193125-13-460513,"market risk and selection risk  market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably.",212

4589,0001193125-16-570175,"if this happens, the fund will not benefit from the rise in market price that normally accompanies a decline in interest rates, and will be forced to reinvest prepayment proceeds at a time when yields on securities available in the market are lower than the yield on the prepaid security.",288
